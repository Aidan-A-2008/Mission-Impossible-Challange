# Rock Paper Scissors | Replit Edition

In this project you will be playing a game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
The computer will randomly choose between rock, paper, and scissors. You will do the same.
Then, the winner will be decided according to the following rules:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
If both the computer and you make the same choice, it is a tie.
You will be playing 5 rounds of the game. Whoever wins more rounds out of 5 is the winner of the game overall.
